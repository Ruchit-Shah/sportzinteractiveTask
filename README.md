The ​Assessment (iOS)
This assessment is for us to test your basic skill set, this includes your technical skills as well ​as ​your ​logical ​& ​organisational ​skills.
For following JSON https://cricket.yahoo.net/sifeeds/cricket/live/json/sapk01222019186652.json
or
https://cricket.yahoo.net/sifeeds/cricket/live/json/nzin01312019187360.json
your task is to create a mobile iOS ​interface ​that ​would ​consume ​and ​output ​the ​data. Assuming the data is being delivered asynchronously from the URL shared above, persist the data ​into ​a ​local ​datastore.
The data contains complete match details. Squads, Teams details, Venue etc.
You have to display squads of both the teams in the best possible way you can imagine. Users should be able to switch between teams. Each squad will be shown as a list with captain and wicket keeper highlighted in some way. There is a reference image at the bottom.
The ​Rules
1.) You may use any libraries of your choice, however the bulk of the solution should be your own ​code.
2.) Write clean and structured code.
3.) Mimicking UI or Better UI
4.) No need to implement core data
5.) Needless to say, solution should work for both URLs
